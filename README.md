# Creation-a-web-application-for-Heart-attack-detection-using-Flask-framework.
This initiative introduces a web application developed using Flask, designed to forecast the likelihood of heart attacks in individuals. By employing logistic regression, a powerful predictive modeling technique, and evaluating results using measures like accuracy and precision.

steps of project :
1.Data Preprocessing and Model Training:
The data employed in this project underwent preparation and refinement through the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook. Subsequently, the model_training.ipynb notebook was utilized to train the logistic regression model using the processed dataset.

2.Building machine learning model for web application:
Shifting our focus to the domain of heart attack prediction, logistic regression takes center stage. Logistic regression is the chosen methodology in this context, aiming to predict the likelihood of a heart attack occurrence based on relevant factors and features. This technique involves training a model to effectively categorize instances into either a heart attack or non-heart attack group, leveraging the principles of logistic regression for accurate predictions.

#3.Evaluation Metrics:
The effectiveness of the developed model is assessed using metrics like the confusion matrix . These measures serve to gauge the precision and success of the predictions. Remarkably, the model achieves an impressive accuracy , indicating its proficiency in capturing and explaining the observed patterns in the data.

4.Frontend Developement:
The user interface of the web application was crafted through the adept combination of HTML and CSS. These technologies synergized to bring forth an interface that seamlessly integrates aesthetics and functionality, ensuring an engaging and user-centric experience.
